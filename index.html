    <p>I am an international student of IMD at Algonquin College and graduated with an Advance Diploma in Graphic Design. 
     I have two years of experience as a freelancer making marketing pieces for social media, catalogues and mailing.</p>
    <p>I enjoy learning new things every day and I feel passionate about discovering more ways to develop my creativity through trends and software. 
    Additionally, Iâ€™m interested in art and realistic painting with coloured pencils. 
    My goal in taking this Interactive media design Diploma is to improve my abilities in web development and also give the first steps to 2D animation and motion graphics.</p>
